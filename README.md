# Viron-m√®tre - source code for PIC18F25K20
Coupled project Polytech' Tours 2015/2016  
  
**The project**  
Create a versatile Bluetooth (low energy) enabled board which allows to hotplug different Grove modules and log the associated sensor data on an Android smartphone.  
This repo contains the code used on the board's MCU, which is a PIC18F25K20.  
This version of the code uses the MCC generated code instead of the now deprecated plib.  
Also, we switched from on-board measure calculations to calculations on the Android smartphone.
